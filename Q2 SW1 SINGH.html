					<td>Jann Mardenborough</td>

					<td>Jann Mardenborough dreams of racing cars, but so far, he only does so repeatedly on a screen through the Gran Turismo console. Jann isn’t your average gamer, though. He knows the details of courses and cars by heart after spending hours designing his own custom rides and racing the same famous tracks that exist all over the world. Jann’s dad puts pressure on him to do something in the realm of reality, especially because his dad played professional soccer, and Jann’s brother Coby is following in their father’s footsteps.</td>

				<tr> 
					<td>Jack Salter</td>

					<td>Jack Salter has many hesitations about taking on the role and heavy responsibility of chief engineer for GT Academy. Danny Moore recruits him while he works for the Capa family and trains Nicholas to drive gold and gaudy race cars. Once Nicholas treats him poorly one too many times, Salter walks and takes the gig preparing gamers to race professional drivers.</td>
					
					<br>

				</tr>
				<tr> 
					<td>Danny Moore</td>

					<td>Danny Moore is the dreamer who kicks off the whole story. In a marketing stunt for Nissan, Moore pitches the idea of GT academy and finding an expert gamer to train for professional racing, to a bunch of suits in Tokyo. Moore’s marketing, can-do attitude gets in the way of the real dangers of racing, with his optimism coming off as insensitive at times, but the engine wouldn’t have started without him.</td>
